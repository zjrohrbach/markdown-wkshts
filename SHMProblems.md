Pendulum Concepts
-------------------------

1. What are the two things that affect the period of a pendulum?
2. Why do you suppose that amplitude does not affect the period of a pendulum?
3. Why do you suppose that mass does not affect the period of the pendulum?
4. Recall: What are the four period and frequency equations?
5. In order to capture video, a video camera takes 32 pictures per second.
	1. What is the frequency with which the camera takes pictures?
	2. What is the period of the camera?
6. A flautist in the marching band makes 120 steps in one minute (60 seconds).
	1. What is the frequency with which the flautist takes step?
	2. What is the period of one step?
7. What is the equation for period of a pendulum?

Pendulum Problems

|  $T_P=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{\ell}{g}}$  |


1. What is the frequency and period of a pendulum that has a mass of 0.25 kg and a length of 2 meters?
2. The same pendulum as discussed in the last problem is taken to another planet, where it has a period of 5.2 seconds.  What is the acceleration of gravity on that other planet?
3. Pendulum A and pendulum B are identical, except that pendulum A has twice as much amplitude.
	1. Which pendulum has the larger period?  How do you know?
	2. Which pendulum has the larger top speed?  How do you know?
	3. Which pendulum has the larger maximum restoring force?  How do you know?

Spring and Pendulum Problems
----------------

1. In the dark of night you are assigned the dubious task of determining the height of a tower upon which you will lay siege.  Conveniently, a pendulum is hanging from the tower to the ground.  If the pendulum has a period of 24 s, how tall is the tower?
2. A pinball machine uses a spring that is compressed **4.0 cm** to launch a ball.  If the spring constant is 13 N/m, what is the force on the ball at the moment the spring is released?  
3. A spring with a spring constant of 30.0 N/m is attached to a 2.3 kg mass, and the system is set in motion.  Find the period and frequency.
4. When a mass of 0.25 kg is attached to a certain spring, it makes 20 complete vibrations in 4.0 s.  What is the spring constant of the spring?
5. Eddie wants to find the spring constant of a spring, so he hangs the spring vertically and attaches a 0.40 kg mass to the springâ€™s end.  If the spring stretches **3.0 cm** from its equilibrium position, what is the spring constant?
