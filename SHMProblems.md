<![if !supportLists]>1. <![endif]>What are the two things that affect the period of a pendulum?

<![if !supportLists]>2. <![endif]>Why do you suppose that amplitude does not affect the period of a pendulum?

<![if !supportLists]>3. <![endif]>Why do you suppose that mass does not affect the period of the pendulum?

<![if !supportLists]>4. <![endif]>In order to capture video, a video camera takes 32 pictures per second.

<![if !supportLists]>a. <![endif]>What is the frequency with which the camera takes pictures?

<![if !supportLists]>b. <![endif]>What is the period of the camera?

<![if !supportLists]>5. <![endif]>A flautist in the marching band makes 120 steps in one minute (60 seconds).

<![if !supportLists]>a. <![endif]>What is the frequency with which the flautist takes step?

<![if !supportLists]>b. <![endif]>What is the period of one step?

  

<![if !supportLists]>6. <![endif]>What is the frequency and period of a pendulum that has a mass of 0.25 kg and a length of 2 meters?

<![if !supportLists]>7. <![endif]>The same pendulum as discussed in the last problem is taken to another planet, where it has a period of 5.2 seconds.  What is the acceleration of gravity on that other planet?

<![if !supportLists]>8. <![endif]>Pendulum A and pendulum B are identical, except that pendulum A has twice as much amplitude.
