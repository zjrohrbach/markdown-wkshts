1. What are the two things that affect the period of a pendulum?
2. Why do you suppose that amplitude does not affect the period of a pendulum?
3. Why do you suppose that mass does not affect the period of the pendulum?
4. Recall: What are the four period and frequency equations
6. In order to capture video, a video camera takes 32 pictures per second.
	1. What is the frequency with which the camera takes pictures?
	2. What is the period of the camera?
7. A flautist in the marching band makes 120 steps in one minute (60 seconds).
	1. What is the frequency with which the flautist takes step?
	2. What is the period of one step?
8. What is the frequency and period of a pendulum that has a mass of 0.25 kg and a length of 2 meters?
9. The same pendulum as discussed in the last problem is taken to another planet, where it has a period of 5.2 seconds.  What is the acceleration of gravity on that other planet?
10. Pendulum A and pendulum B are identical, except that pendulum A has twice as much amplitude.
	1. Which pendulum has the larger period?  How do you know?
	2. Which pendulum has the larger top speed?  How do you know?
	3. Which pendulum has the larger maximum restoring force?  How do you know?
