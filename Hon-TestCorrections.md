**Test Correction Eligibility:** As noted on the Syllabus, to be eligible for test corrections, 

**Multiple Choice (MC) Computer Portion:** Every test question corrected is entitled to half credit back.  
  
**Free Response (FR) Paper Portion:** This must be done either in class or during SRT.
  
**[LINK TO THE MC TEST](https://avon.schoology.com/assignment/4925783860/course/5138386902/assessments/5144956991)**  
  
A valid correction has three parts: (1) Question number, (2) Correct answer, (3) An explanation of why your first answer was wrong or why your new answer was right. (_**Without part 3, I won't grade your corrections!**_)  
  
You may either type your corrections and upload them or handwrite them, scan them, and upload them.
