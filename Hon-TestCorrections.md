**Test Correction Eligibility:** As noted on the Course Information Guide, 
> In order to be eligible for test corrections, _you must have no outstanding lab assignments and must have at least an 80% on your homework score for that chapter._ Test corrections are due by midterm.  In other words, test corrections for units completed before the midterm will not be accepted after the midterm.

**Multiple Choice (MC) Computer Portion:** Every test question corrected is entitled to half credit back.  
  
**Free Response (FR) Paper Portion:** This must be done either in class or during SRT.

A valid correction has three parts: (1) Question number, (2) Correct answer, (3) An explanation of why your first answer was wrong or why your new answer was right. (_**Without part 3, I won't grade your corrections!**_)  
  
You may either type your corrections and upload them or handwrite them, scan them, and upload them.
