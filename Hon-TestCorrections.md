**Computer Portion:** Every test question corrected is entitled to half credit back.  
  
**Paper Portion:** You can correct the paper portion if you had D or F, but it must be during SRT and the maximum corrected grade is 70% (14/20).  
  
**[LINK TO THE TEST (Computer Portion)](https://avon.schoology.com/course/2624603229/assessments/4709630386)**  
  
A valid correction has three parts: (1) Question number, (2) Correct answer, (3) An explanation of why your first answer was wrong or why your new answer was right. (_**Without part 3, I won't grade your corrections!**_)  
  
You may either type your corrections and upload them or handwrite them, scan them, and upload them.
