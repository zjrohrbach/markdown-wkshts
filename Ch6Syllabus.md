# Chapter 6: Work & Energy
## Syllabus



### Essential Question: 

How can motion be explained using work and energy?  How is this similar and different to explaining motion with Newton’s Laws?

### Equations:

|             |                 |                      |            |                        |               |                              |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| $W=F_{\parallel}d$ | $P=\frac{W}{t}$ | $KE=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ | $PE_g=mgy$ | $PE_e=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ | $W=\Delta KE$ | $\Sigma E_0+W_{NC}=\Sigma E$ |

### Key Questions:

 * How are work and energy defined
 * What are the different types of energy?
 * When and how can conservation of energy be used to solve problems?
 * What is the strength of using energy concepts instead of Newton’s Laws?

*Homework is provided below.  Please remember to show all work, especially your knowns and unknowns.  Answers without work will not receive credit.*
