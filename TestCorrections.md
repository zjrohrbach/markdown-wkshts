Every question on the computer portion of the test is entitled to be corrected for half credit back.  
  
**[LINK TO THE TEST](https://avon.schoology.com/assignment/4586396402/)**  
  
A valid correction has three parts: (1) Question number, (2) Correct answer, (3) An explanation of why your first answer was wrong or why your new answer was right. (_**Without part 3, I won't grade your corrections!**_)  
  
You may either type your corrections and upload them or handwrite them, scan them, and upload them.
