1. A baseball is thrown by a pitcher with a velocity of 43 m/s. The batter hits straight back at the pitcher with a velocity of 56 m/s. The 0.145-kg ball was in contact with the bat for 0.0007 s.
	1. What was the impulse imparted by the bat?
	2. What was the force applied by the bat?
2. While washing your car, water comes out of the hose at a rate of 1.5 kg/s and speed of 20 m/s.  How much force does the water impart on your car?
3. A piece of putty and a bouncy ball, each of mass 0.035 kg, are thrown up against a wall. They each have an initial velocity of 5 m/s, but the bouncy ball returns towards the thrower with the same velocity, while the putty sticks to the wall.  Which object will experience a larger impulse?
4. A red 400-kg bumper car is traveling at 8 m/s. It hits the back of a stationary 155-kg green bumper car. After the collision, the red car has a velocity of 3.3 m/s (still forward). What is the final velocity of the green car?
