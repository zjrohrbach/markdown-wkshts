### Conceptual Questions

A piece of putty and a bouncy ball, each of mass 0.035 kg, are thrown up against a wall. They each have an initial velocity of 5 m/s, but the bouncy ball returns towards the thrower with the same velocity, while the putty sticks to the wall.  Which object will experience a larger impulse?



You drop two identical vases from the same height.  One lands on a pillow and the other lands on a concrete floor.
- (a) Which one experiences a larger *impulse*?
- (b) Which one experiences a larger *force*?

1. A baseball is thrown by a pitcher with a velocity of 43 m/s. The batter hits straight back at the pitcher with a velocity of 56 m/s. The 0.145-kg ball was in contact with the bat for 0.0007 s.
	1. What was the impulse imparted by the bat?
	2. What was the average force applied by the bat?
2. While washing your car, water comes out of the hose at a rate of 1.5 kg/s and speed of 20 m/s.  How much force does the water impart on your car?
3. A 900-kg cannon fires a 5-kg cannonball at a speed of 30 m/s.  How fast does the cannon recoil?
