Thank you for your help today!  

## Period 2 - Integrated Chem/Phys (ICP) - 8:25-9:51

 Please turn on the projector and show the video posted at **_________________________________________________**.  The video will periodically pause itself.  Give students the appropriate amount of time at each pause and then continue the video.

1. On the way in, students should know to pick up their notebook.
2. Start the video.  On the video, I will remind students of expectations,
3. The video will pause.  Students will have 10 minutes to read silently.  This is how we begin every class, so students should be prepared.  If they forgot their book, there are articles on the back counter they can read.  Phones should not be out during Silent Reading.
4. After 10 minutes, resume the video.  I will introduce them to the test.
	- Most students have a test already provided to them in their notebook
	- I have a few students who forgot to turn in their notebooks.  Their tests and scantrons are on my desk.
	- If---for some reason---there isn't a test or a scantron for a student, I've left some extra copies on my desk.
	- Students are allowed to use their notebook and a calculator, but phones and computers should be put away.
	- If a student needs to borrow a calculator, I have some on the wooden desk to the side of the main desk.  I usually ask students to give me an ID, agenda, or something of value as collateral to make sure I get my calculators back.
5. The following students are allowed to go to the Testing Center in D109 if they ask (although they usually don't).  I have already written out passes for them (although you should write the time down): Jillian Archer, Bella Cardin, Will Clinton, Donovan Seaborn, Tara Toth
6. When all students in the room are finished (even if some are still testing in the Testing Center), you may resume the video.
7. At the end of the video is a link to a Bill Nye video that you can watch for the rest of class.

## SRT - 9:57-11:31

If you have access, please show announcements.

Students may leave if they have a pass.  However, they should sign out where they are going in the green binder on the front table.  (They know this).  Please make sure that they show you their pass.

If a student does not have a pass, don't let them leave.

I have a restroom pass in the front pocket of the green binder that students may use.  Please only allow one student at a time in the restroom.

Please send any students who come back to their SRT.

## Period 4 - Prep - 11:37-1:38

## Period 6 - Physics I - 1:44-3:10
