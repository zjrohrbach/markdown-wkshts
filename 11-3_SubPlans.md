Thank you for your help today!  

## Period 2 - Integrated Chem/Phys (ICP) - 8:25-9:51

*This class will require some more leading from you.*  They are not as proficient at Schoology, so I am going to have you show the video to them.  The video will walk them through the first assignment and then remind them how to log in to Schoology to complete the second assignment.

If students give you any trouble, please don't hesitate to send students out and/or write me a message to deal with discipline upon my return.

1. On the way in, students should know to pick up their notebook.
2. Class begins with 10 minutes of silent reading.  Their phones should be put away, and they should have a book that they are reading.  If they forgot their book, there are articles on the back counter they can read.
3. After Silent Reading is over, hand out the "More NSL Practice" worksheet.
4. Please turn on the projector and show the video posted at _________________________________________________.  The video will periodically pause itself.  Give students a chance to respond to answer the question on their worksheet before continuing the video.
5. When this is finished, students should turn their papers in to you.
6. Finally, have students complete the Review Assignment that is posted on Schoology.  (If they don't have a computer today, they may use their phone.)
7. At the end of the period, students should return their notebooks into the appropriate bin at the front of the room.

## SRT - 9:57-11:31

If you have access, please show announcements.

Students may leave if they have a pass.  However, they should sign out where they are going in the green binder on the front table.  (They know this).  Please make sure that they show you their pass.

If a student does not have a pass, don't let them leave.

I have a restroom pass in the front pocket of the green binder that students may use.  Please only allow one student at a time in the restroom.

Please send any students who come back to their SRT.

## Period 4 - Prep - 11:37-1:38

## Period 6 - Physics I - 1:44-3:10

These students are taking a test.  

Please hand out the test.  There are A- B- and C- versions.  Hand them out in an alternating pattern so that students can't cheat.

Also, please hand out the Equation Slips.

Students will complete part of their test on this paper and part on the computer.  When they are finished, they should turn in the paper test to you.

If a student needs to borrow a calculator, I have some on the wood desk in my room (they know where they are).  I usually have students trade me an agenda, an ID, or something of value as collateral to make sure they remember to give it back.

For your reference, here are the notes I put on Schoology for the students


> *I'm sorry to not be here today... No, the baby isn't here.  Unfortunately, someone at my daughter's daycare tested positive, so I'm at home with her...*
> 
> *Please be on your best behavior for the sub.*
> 
> ***Phones should be put away during the test.  If you need a calculator, please ask.***
> 
> 1.  The sub will hand out your Paper Test and an Equation Sheet
> 2. Please show all of your work on the paper test.
> 3. Also, please complete the [online portion of the test](https://avon.schoology.com/assignment/5416645854/).  If you need room for scratch work, you may use the back of your test.
> 4. Turn the paper test in when you are finished.
