Springs
===

1. You hang 0.5 kg of oranges on a grocery scale and the spring stretches 4 cm.  What is  the spring constant?
2. When you hang 0.60 kg on a spring, it oscillates at 3.0 Hz.  What will be the frequency if you take the 0.60 kg off and instead hang 0.38 kg on the spring?

Energy in SHO's; Eq of Motion

1. A 0.60-kg mass is placed on a spring and set to oscillate with an amplitude of 13 cm.  Its frequency is 3.0 Hz.
	1. Calculate the maximum speed of the mass.
	2. How fast is the mass moving when its displacement from equilibrium is 9 cm?
	3. Write down the equation for motion of the mass.
2. An object of mass 0.75 kg oscillates according to the equation $x(t)=0.45\cos(6.40 \cdot t)$, where $x$ is measured in meters and $t$ is measured in seconds.
	1. What is the amplitude?
	2. What is the frequency?
	3. What is the total energy of the system?

Eqs of Motion & Desmos
===
  
1. Go to <https://www.desmos.com/calculator>  
2. Consider a spring system that has the equation of motion $x(t)=0.5 \sin(12.57\cdot t)$.  
	1. What is the amplitude of motion?  
	2. What is the frequency of motion?  
	3. Plot this equation on Desmos and explain how it the resulting graph matches your answers for (a) and (b).  
	4. Where will the mass on the end of the spring be located at a time of 1.6 seconds?  
	5. Also plot $x(t)=0.5 \cos(12.57\cdot t)$.  What's the diffeerence between these two graphs?  
	6. In what physical situation would you use $\cos(2\pi f \cdot t)$ instead of $\sin(2\pi f \cdot t)$?  
3. Now, try plotting $x(t)=A\sin(2\pi f \cdot t)$ on Desmos.  Use the "slider" capability of Desmos to investigate how changing $f$ and $A$ changes the graph.
