# Emergency Sub Plans

If I haven't provided any other plans, it is likely because my wife has gone into labor.  If there are other plans provided, they should take precedence.

Thank you for your help today!

Plan for all classes
---------------------
1. Tell students to log in to Schoology and go to the folder labeled **Mytbusters Day!!**
2. Have the students read the assignment.  For your reference, it is reproduced below:
	> Watch the "Killer Whirlpool" episode of _MythBusters_.  Answer these questions after it is over.
	> 
	> Expectations for watching
	> 
	> -   Phones should be away
	> -   You should not be talking
	> -   You don't need to start answering the questions until after the episode is over, but be thinking about them while you are watching.
	> - Please do not give the sub any issues. If there are any issues while I am out for my leave, you can expect a detention when I return.
	> 
	> Here are the questions:
	> 
	> 1.  Pick one of the two myths (Killer Whirlpool or Snowplow). Explain the myth and summarize how the episode tested that myth.
	> 2.  Explain whether or not the myth was busted and why.
	> 3.  Write down one question of something that was confusing or something you would like to know more about.
3. After they have read the assignment, show the *Mythbusters* "Killer Whirlpool" episode.  It should last about 40 minutes. 
4. When finished, give the students time to answer the questions on Schoology and submit their answers.
