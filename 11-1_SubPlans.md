# Mon, Nov 8

Thank you for your help today!  

## Period 1 - Honors Physics - 8:25-9:51


## Period 3 - Physics I - 9:57-11:31




## Period 5 - Physics I - 11:37-1:38

**We eat C-lunch at 12:37**

This lesson plan is the same as Period 3.  I would hope students would finish the test before lunch.  But, if not, they may finish afterwards.  (I know that it's not the most test-secure thing in the world, so don't advertise this fact.  However, I'm fine if some students need extra time after lunch to finish.)


## Period 7 - Integrated Chem/Phys (ICP) - 1:44-3:10


 Please turn on the projector and show the video posted at _________________________________________________.  The video will periodically pause itself.  Give students the appropriate amount of time at each pause and then continue the video.

1. On the way in, students should know to pick up their notebook.
2. Start the video.  On the video, I will remind students of expectations,
3. The video will pause.  Students will have 10 minutes to read silently.  This is how we begin every class, so students should be prepared.  If they forgot their book, there are articles on the back counter they can read.  Phones should not be out during Silent Reading.
4. After 10 minutes, resume the video.  I will introduce them to the test.
	- Most students have a test already provided to them in their notebook
	- I have a few students who forgot to turn in their notebooks.  Their tests and scantrons are on my desk.
	- If--for some reason--there isn't a test or a scantron for a student, I've left some extra copies on my desk.
6. 
5. Please turn on the projector and show the video posted at _________________________________________________.  The video will periodically pause itself.  Give students a chance to respond to answer the question on their worksheet before continuing the video.
6. When this is finished, students should turn their papers in to you.
7. Finally, have students complete the Review Assignment that is posted on Schoology.  (If they don't have a computer today, they may use their phone.)
8. At the end of the period, students should return their notebooks into the appropriate bin at the front of the room.
