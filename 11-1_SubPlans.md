# Mon, Nov 1

Thank you for your help today!  

## Period 1 - Honors Physics - 8:25-9:51

Students will be self directed.  Hand out the PowerPoint slides and tell them to log in to schoology to read the assignment.  For your reference, here is what I'm telling them to do:

> *I'm sorry to not be here today... No, the baby isn't here.  Unfortunately, someone at my daughter's daycare tested positive, so I'm at home with her...*
> 
>  
> 1. Please watch the **Review EdPuzzle**.  The sub will had out a packet for you to follow along.
> 		- you may work with a partner
> 		- it is not for a grade
>		- please excuse to low quality; it's just a recording of class from last year.
> 2. I will log in to Zoom at 9:30 to answer any questions you have.
> 3. Test is still next class.
> 4. There will be no E-Learning for tomorrow, other than finish the syllabus and be ready for the test.

## Period 3 - Physics I - 9:57-11:31

These students are taking a test.  

Please hand out the test.  There are A- B- and C- versions.  Hand them out in an alternating pattern so that students can't cheat.

Also, please hand out the Equation Slips.

Students will complete part of their test on this paper and part on the computer.  When they are finished, they should turn in the paper test to you.

If a student needs to borrow a calculator, I have some on the wood desk in my room (they know where they are).  I usually have students trade me an agenda, an ID, or something of value as collateral to make sure they remember to give it back.

For your reference, here are the notes I put on Schoology for the students


> *I'm sorry to not be here today... No, the baby isn't here.  Unfortunately, someone at my daughter's daycare tested positive, so I'm at home with her...*
> 
> *Please be on your best behavior for the sub.*
> 
> ***Phones should be put away during the test.  If you need a calculator, please ask.***
> 
> 1.  The sub will hand out your Paper Test and an Equation Sheet
> 2. Please show all of your work on the paper test.
> 3. Also, please complete the [online portion of the test](https://avon.schoology.com/assignment/5416645854/).  If you need room for scratch work, you may use the back of your test.
> 4. Turn the paper test in when you are finished.


## Period 5 - Physics I - 11:37-1:38

**We eat C-lunch at 12:37**

This lesson plan is the same as Period 3.  I would hope students would finish the test before lunch.  But, if not, they may finish afterwards.  (I know that it's not the most test-secure thing in the world, so don't advertise this fact.  However, I'm fine if some students need extra time after lunch to finish.)


## Period 7 - Integrated Chem/Phys (ICP) - 1:44-3:10

*This class will require some more leading from you.*  They are not as proficient at Schoology, so I am going to have you show the video to them.  The video will walk them through the first assignment and then remind them how to log in to Schoology to complete the second assignment.

If students give you any trouble, please don't hesitate to send students out and/or write me a message to deal with discipline upon my return.

1. On the way in, students should know to pick up their notebook.
2. Class begins with 10 minutes of silent reading.  Their phones should be put away, and they should have a book that they are reading.  If they forgot their book, there are articles on the back counter they can read.
3. After Silent Reading is over, hand out the "More NSL Practice" worksheet.
4. Please turn on the projector and show the video posted at _________________________________________________.  The video will periodically pause itself.  Give students a chance to respond to answer the question on their worksheet before continuing the video.
5. When this is finished, students should turn their papers in to you.
6. Finally, have students complete the Review Assignment that is posted on Schoology.  (If they don't have a computer today, they may use their phone.)
7. At the end of the period, students should return their notebooks into the appropriate bin at the front of the room.
