Thank you for your help today!  

## Period 1 - Honors Physics - 8:25-9:51


## Period 3 - Physics I - 9:57-11:31




## Period 5 - Physics I - 11:37-1:38

**We eat C-lunch at 12:37**

This lesson plan is the same as Period 3.  I would hope students would finish the test before lunch.  But, if not, they may finish afterwards.  (I know that it's not the most test-secure thing in the world, so don't advertise this fact.  However, I'm fine if some students need extra time after lunch to finish.)


## Period 7 - Integrated Chem/Phys (ICP) - 1:44-3:10


 Please turn on the projector and show the video posted at _________________________________________________.  The video will periodically pause itself.  Give students the to respond to answer the question on their worksheet before continuing the video.

1. On the way in, students should know to pick up their notebook.
2. Class begins with 10 minutes of silent reading.  Their phones should be put away, and they should have a book that they are reading.  If they forgot their book, there are articles on the back counter they can read.
3. After Silent Reading is over, hand out the "More NSL Practice" worksheet.
4. Please turn on the projector and show the video posted at _________________________________________________.  The video will periodically pause itself.  Give students a chance to respond to answer the question on their worksheet before continuing the video.
5. When this is finished, students should turn their papers in to you.
6. Finally, have students complete the Review Assignment that is posted on Schoology.  (If they don't have a computer today, they may use their phone.)
