Thu, Sept 2 / Fri, Sept 3
=====================

Objectives
------------
- Be able to use the Kinematic Equations to solve horizontal-motion problems

Agenda  
---------  

1. SSR
2. Notes: Kinematic Equations <sub>[Video][v]</sub>
3. Do [Kinematics #1][k1]
4. (*time permitting*) Work on Test Corrections (*[link to Concept Portion][test]*)


*If you are absent, watch the video versions of the notes and try Kinematics #1.  I'm going to take a completion grade on it.*



Announcements
-------------  
- You can do test corrections on the [Concept Portion][test] of the test.  Turn them in when they are finished.
- If you'd like to do test corrections on the Problem Portion, get an SRT pass from me.
