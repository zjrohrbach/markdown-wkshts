Tue, Sept 7 / Wed, Sept 8
=====================

Objectives
------------
- Be able to use the Kinematic Equations to solve horizontal-motion problems.
- Be able to explain how objects in free fall behave.

Agenda  
---------  

1. SSR
2. Do [Kinematics #2][k2]
3. Notes: Free Fall <sub>[video][v]</sub>
4. Work time
	- Test Corrections (*[link to Concept Portion][test]*)
	- [Kinematics #3][k3]


*If you are absent, watch the video versions of the notes and try Kinematics #2-3.  I'm going to take a completion grade on Kinematics #3 (but not #2), so please send me a picture of your work on that one.*



Announcements
-------------  
- You can do test corrections on the [Concept Portion][test] of the test.  Turn them in when they are finished.
- If you'd like to do test corrections on the Problem Portion, get an SRT pass from me.
