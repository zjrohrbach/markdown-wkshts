Culminating Project
===============

Workday #1
---------------

### Questions you should be able to answer…

- _If you have a physics topic, you should be able to answer these questions:_ What is your topic?  What is the science behind how it works?  Why is it interesting/important?
- _If you have a scientist, you should be able to answer these questions:_ Who is your person?  What science is he/she known for? What do his/her theories say?  Why is he/she interesting/important?
- _If you have a build-it project, you should be able to answer these questions:_ What is the thing you are building?  What is its purpose?  What is the science behind how it works?  Why is it interesting/important? What materials will you need?


**Also, start thinking about your visual.**  Remember, your project should be built around a diagram, graph, model, etc. that substantially contributes to our understanding of the topic.  _A presentation aid (like PowerPoint, Prezi, etc.) is not a visual!_

### Assignment

You will eventually turn in an annotated bibliography that meets the following requirements:

<![if !supportLists]>1. <![endif]>You should have **three sources**.  Each source should be cited in MLA style.

<![if !supportLists]>2. <![endif]>Each source should include either a bulleted list of information you will use from that source or a 3-4 sentence paragraph explaining that information **in your own words**.

<![if !supportLists]>3. <![endif]>As you continue to do research, you may find you need more sources.  You are encouraged to have more than three sources!  Additional sources, however, do not need to include summaries.

<![if !supportLists]>4. <![endif]>All sources should also be cited in your final presentation.

You can go to [http://www.bibme.org/mla/website-citation](http://www.bibme.org/mla/website-citation) for help in writing a citation.  Please use **“manual entry mode.”**  Automatic mode is riddled with errors.  You can also look on the back of this page for basic citation format.

**Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo, Dictionary.com, Answers.com, _etc._ do NOT count as sources!!**

I suggest starting with the "Science in Context" database.  There is a link in the “Culminating Project” folder on Schoology.  There is also a link on the AHS Library’s homepage.

  

**Basic Citation for an article not from a database:**

Author. “Title of article.” _Title of Website_. Publisher, Publication Date.

<url>

**Basic Citation for an article from a database:**

(Scroll down to the bottom of the page.  Usually there is a citation provided for you.)

**Basic Citation for a book:**

Author. “Title of Article.” _Title of Book._  Publisher, year, page number.
