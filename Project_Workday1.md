Culminating Project
===============

Workday #1
---------------

### First, watch these two videos:



### Second, use these questions to guide your research today:

- _If you have a physics topic, you should be able to answer these questions:_ What is your topic?  What is the science behind how it works?  Why is it interesting/important?
- _If you have a scientist, you should be able to answer these questions:_ Who is your person?  What science is he/she known for? What do his/her theories say?  Why is he/she interesting/important?
- _If you have a build-it project, you should be able to answer these questions:_ What is the thing you are building?  What is its purpose?  What is the science behind how it works?  Why is it interesting/important? What materials will you need?
- **Also, start thinking about your visual.**  Remember, your project should be built around a diagram, graph, model, etc. that substantially contributes to our understanding of the topic.  _A presentation aid (like PowerPoint, Prezi, etc.) is not a visual!_

### Third, get started on your Annotated Bibliography Assignment

You will eventually turn in an annotated bibliography that meets the following requirements:

1. You should have **three sources**.  Make sure to keep the links to the sources and copy them into your word document.
2. Each source should include either a bulleted list of information you will use from that source or a 3-4 sentence paragraph explaining that information **in your own words**.
3. Each source should be cited in MLA style. (*You do not need to do this part now.  We will talk about how to do MLA citations next week.*)

**Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo, Dictionary.com, Answers.com, _etc._ do NOT count as sources!!**

I suggest starting with the materials provided on [Mrs. Young's research page](https://sites.google.com/view/ahs-library/science/physics)!
