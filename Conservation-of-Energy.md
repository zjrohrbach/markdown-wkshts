Conservation of Energy Practice 
=========================

	
1. A 2-kg block is kicked up a ramp with an initial speed of 5 m/s.
	- (a) Assuming no friction, how high up the ramp would the block reach?
	- (b) Instead, the block only makes it up 1.1 meters.  How much work was done by friction?

2. A spring of constant $k=$ 200 N/m is used in the launcher of a pinball machine. The player pulls back on the knob, so the spring is compressed by 0.15 m from its equilibrium position by a pinball of mass 0.13 kg. When the spring is released, the ball is shot forward (it is not attached to the spring). After release the ball moves forward across a level, frictionless surface, and then moves up the slanted pinball surface.

   - (a) The top of the ramp is at a height of $h=0.2$ m above the starting point.  How fast is the ball moving here?
	- (b) If instead, it is only moving at 4.9 m/s, how much work is done by friction?
