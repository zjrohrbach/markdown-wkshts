Project Checklist  
---------------------  
  
- Have I turned my three sources in (with summaries)?  
- Are my sources cited _in my presentation_?  
- Do I know my topic well enough that I can explain it **in my own words**?  
- Do I know my topic well enough that I can answers questions about it?  
- Does my project thoroughly cover the _physics_ of my topic (not just the history or the biography)?  
- Is my presentation 5-7 minutes?  
- Have I included my visual? (see below)  
  
Your Visual Aid  
------------------  
  
- You are to have one image, graph, diagram, or picture   
- This is separate than your *presentation aid* (PowerPoint, poster, etc.)  
- Your visual should substantially contribute to understanding your topic (For example, a picture of Albert Einstein does not substantially contribute to our understanding of Einstein.  A diagram of how the photoelectric effect—something he is famous for describing—works does substantially contribute)  
- Your visual should be something you’ve made, not just a Google Image.  It can be _based_ off of something you’ve found, but you should do something to make it your own.  
- If you’ve built something, the thing you built can be your visual.  
- You need to be able to **explain** your visual.

On the Grading Rubric
-----------------------------
This is an extended project, and every year I have students who think my grading rubric is a little harsher than they are used to seeing.  As such, I think it is important to summarize what differentiates A-level, B-level, and C-level projects.

- **C projects** are projects that generally meet the requirements.  Usually they are a simple power point or poster.  The student explains the topic well enough, but the explanation does not go very far in depth.  A C-project gets the idea across, but it lead me to learning more about the topic than I could have done by simply reading one of your sources.
- **B projects** are good, solid projects.  Students are well aware of what they are talking about and can answer my questions.  A well-done poster or power point is probably a B project.  You should be proud of a B project!
- **A projects** go above and beyond.  There is something about the project that makes it stick out: either a creative flair, a passion in how the student presents it, or a description that makes me think about something in a way I never have before.
- **A+ projects** are projects that I could not imagine having been done any better!  I have given A+’s before, but they are few and far between

If you look at the rubric, you will realize that if you meet all standards, you will get a 91%.  Does that mean it is impossible to get a 100%?  No, of course not.  But perfect projects go above and beyond in multiple respects: they are remarkably well researched, they are very creative (something I have either not seen before or not seen completed nearly as well), and they really stick in my mind as outstanding projects.  If you want a 100% you will need to work very hard _and_ have a fantastic idea that you learn inside and out!!!
