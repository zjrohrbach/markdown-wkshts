1. The Sun subtends an angle of about 0.5 degrees to us on Earth, 150 million km away.  Estimate the radius of the Sun.
2. A bicycle has wheels of diameter 68 cm.  If the bicycle travels 92 km, how many rotations do the wheels make?
3. A wheel of radius 1.3 meters is accelerating at a rate of 12 rad/s<sup>2</sup>.  At the moment that the wheel is rotating at 3.2 rad/s,
	1. What is the magnitude of *tangential* acceleration at a point on the outside of the wheel?
	2. What is the magnitude of *radial* (centripetal) acceleration at a point on the outside of the wheel?
	3. What is the magnitude of the *total* acceleration at a point on the outside of the wheel?
