1. The Sun subtends an angle of about 0.5 degrees to us on Earth, 150 million km away.  Estimate the radius of the Sun.
2. A bicycle has wheels of diameter 68 cm.  If the bicycle travels 92 km, how many rotations do the wheels make?
3. A wheel of radius 1.3 meters is accelerating at a rate of 12 rad/s<sup>2</sup>.  At the moment that the wheel is rotating at 3.2 rad/s,
	1. What is the magnitude of *tangential* acceleration at a point on the outside of the wheel?
	2. What is the magnitude of *radial* (centripetal) acceleration at a point on the outside of the wheel?
	3. What is the magnitude of the *total* acceleration at a point on the outside of the wheel?

1. Pilots can be tested for the stresses of flying high-speed jets in a whirling “human centrifuge,” which starts at rest and takes 1.0 min to turn through 20 complete revolutions before reaching its final speed.
	1. What was its angular acceleration (assumed constant)?
	2. What was its final angular speed **in rpm**?
2. A bicycle has wheels of diameter 68 cm.  If the bicycle decelerates from 8.4 m/s to rest over a distance of 115 meters, find the angular acceleration of the wheel.



Torque
======

1. (*period 2 only*) Pilots can be tested for the stresses of flying high-speed jets in a whirling “human centrifuge,” which starts at rest and takes 1.0 min to turn through 20 complete revolutions before reaching its final speed.
	1. What was its angular acceleration (assumed constant)?
	2. What was its final angular speed **in rpm**?
2. Consider the following situation:

	1. Calculate the net torque about point $S$ if $m_1=10~\text{kg}$, $m_2=20~\text{kg}$, and $m_3=30~\text{kg}$
	2. If you took $m_3$ off, what mass could you replace it with such that the system would balance?



3. A torque of $1.20~\text{m}\cdot\text{N}$ is applied to a disk of mass 4.80 kg

Symbols
--------------
1. What symbol is measured in rad?
2. What does $\ell$ stand for?
3. What symbol would it be if I said that you had rotated through 18 rev?
4. What symbol would it be if I said that you were rotating at 1300 rpm?

Relationships
