1. A block is pushed with force of 100 N over a displacement of 2.3 m.
	1. What is the work done on the block?
	2. If it took 0.9 s to do this, what is the power output on the block?
2. It takes 50000 J of work to push a car 1371 m.  What force is required?
3. A 100-Watt light bulb is left on for 33 s.  How much work does it do?
4. A 3-kg watermelon is lifted 3 m into the air:
	1. Calculate the force that you are doing work against.
	2. How much work is needed to lift the watermelon that high (think about your answer to a to help with this answer)?
	3. If it took you 5.1 s to lift it 3 m, what is your power?
5. A cable lifts a 2600-kg elevator to height of 300m in a time of 8 seconds.  What power does the motor produce in accomplishing this task? (*Hint: You’ll need to find the work done first; use problem 4 to help you as they are similar problems*)

1. A 1.3 kg apple is hanging 2.5 m above the ground.
	1. What is its potential energy?
	2. What would be the work required to lift it to that height in the air?
	3. What do you notice about your answers to (a) and (b)?  Why does this make sense?
2. What is the kinetic energy of a car with a mass of 1000 kg traveling with a velocity of 15.5 m/s?
3. What is the speed of a 1500-kg airplane with 7,350,000 J of Kinetic Energy?
4. A 0.2 kg hockey puck is sitting on the ice.  A player exerts a constant 15.6 N force over a distance of 0.150 m.
	1. How much work does the hockey player do on the puck?
	2. If the puck’s initial velocity was 0 m/s, determine its final velocity.
5. You slide a trashcan (m = 10.2 kg) across the floor with an initial velocity of 7.9 m/s.  If the trashcan eventually stops, what is the work done by friction?

Warmup
======
1. While climbing the stairs…
	1. ...did you do more work if you were going fast or slow?
	2. ...did you output more power if you were going fast or slow?
2. While climbing at a constant speed…
	1. …did you do more work if you climbed the stairs half-way or if you climbed the stairs the full way?
	2. …did you output more power if you climbed the stairs half-way or if you climbed the stairs the full way?


Conservation

2. You are playing ski-ball.  You roll a ball (m = 0.20 kg) up from the bottom of the ramp with an initial speed of 7 m/s.  By the time the ball reaches the top of the frictionless ramp (which has a height of 1.5 meters), how fast is the ball travelling?
3. Starting from rest, a child zooms down a frictionless slide from an initial height of 3.00 m.  What is her speed at the bottom of the slide?  Assume she has a mass of 25.0 kg.
4. Robert (m = 75 kg) starts at rest at the top of a carnival slide, which is 20 m above the ground.  As he slides down, friction does 1500 J of work.  How fast is he going when he gets to the ground?
5. A 1300-kg roller coaster starts at rest on the top of a 60-meter hill.  The track goes down to ground level before going up a second hill with a height of 35 meters.  There is no friction
	1. Draw a picture
	2. How fast is the coaster travelling at the bottom of the first hill?
	3. How fast is the coaster travelling at the top of the second hill?
	4. Now, let’s add friction to this problem.  With friction, the roller coaster does not make it to the top of the second hill; instead, it only reaches a height of 30 m before stopping.  How much work is done by friction?


6. A rollercoaster (m = 1000 kg) starts from rest at the top of a 50 m hill.  The tracks are frictionless.
	1. If the hill goes all the way down to the ground, how fast should it be going at that point?
	2. Continuing the problem, the rollercoaster continues to the top of the next hill, which is 35 m high.  What is its velocity at the top of the next hill?
