1. A block is pushed with force of 100 N over a displacement of 2.3 m.
	1. What is the work done on the block?
	2. If it took 0.9 s to do this, what is the power output on the block?
2. It takes 50000 J of work to push a car 1371 m.  What force is required?
3. A 100-Watt light bulb is left on for 33 s.  How much work does it do?
4. A 3-kg watermelon is lifted 3 m into the air:
	1. Calculate the force that you are doing work against.
	2. How much work is needed to lift the watermelon that high (think about your answer to a to help with this answer)?
	3. If it took you 5.1 s to lift it 3 m, what is your power?
5. A cable lifts a 2600-kg elevator to height of 300m in a time of 8 seconds.  What power does the motor produce in accomplishing this task? (*Hint: You’ll need to find the work done first; use problem 4 to help you as they are similar problems*)

1. A 1.3 kg apple is hanging 2.5 m above the ground.
	1. What is its potential energy?
	2. What would be the work required to lift it to that height in the air?
	3. What do you notice about your answers to (a) and (b)?  Why does this make sense?
2. What is the kinetic energy of a car with a mass of 1000 kg traveling with a velocity of 15.5 m/s?
3. What is the speed of a 1500-kg airplane with 7,350,000 J of Kinetic Energy?
4. A 0.2 kg hockey puck is sitting on the ice.  A player exerts a constant 15.6 N force over a distance of 0.150 m.
	1. How much work does the hockey player do on the puck?
	2. If the puck’s initial velocity was 0 m/s, determine its final velocity.
5. You slide a trashcan (m = 10.2 kg) across the floor with an initial velocity of 7.9 m/s.  If the trashcan eventually stops, what is the work done by friction?

6. Two cars are traveling down the highway. They have the same mass, but car #2 is traveling twice as fast as car #1. Which car has the larger kinetic energy, and by how much? (_This is not a math problem; it’s a thinking problem!_)
